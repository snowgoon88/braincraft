* Goal
develop some tools to help understand solutions.
- from model  => visualization of network (using graphviz/dot)
- from player => overview visu + plotting of some network values
                 save as movie ?
                 save network activity ?
** Install
python3 -m venv env_braincraft
source env_braincraft/bin/activate
python -m pip install -t requirements.txt

ou

python -m pip install numpy matplotlib tqdm
** usage
python debug_plot.py info_switcher_alt.json
* Current: visu of network
* [1/1] player_viz
** DONE [/] overview + plotting of some network values
** save as movie => see matplotlib.FuncAnimation
** save network activity
* [3/3] visualization of network
** DONE use pydot to generate graph
** DONE detect from_nodes, to_nodes and non-nul weights from W matrix
** DONE import model and play
